	<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Basheer. I'm an industrial designer with a firm belief that products should feel beautifully designed even after the first button press.</p>
	<p>I work and prototype in a unique blend of electronics hardware, visualization software, &amp; design techniques in order to craft character, personality, &amp; delightful interactions for consumer electronics.</p>
	<p>I spend the better half of my free time behind a <a href="http://click.basheertome.com/land" target="_blank">lens</a>, <a href="http://click.basheertome.com/travel" target="_blank">traveling</a>, or <a href="http://thatwasdelicious.com/" target="_blank">eating</a>, ideally doing all three at once.</p>
