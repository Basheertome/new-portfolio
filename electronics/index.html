	<p>I began learning how to work with custom circuit boards both on the programming and fabrication side. I've worked on a few projects that have incorporated the things I've learned so far, but here are a few good examples.</p>

	<p>This first, albeit meta, project focused on creating a programming chip from a single-layer copper board, soldering some surface-mount components, and then finally programming it to run smoothly.</p>

	<p>From there I dove into learning how to use Eagle, one of the more widely used circuit board design tools and used it to create a "simple" board that measures capacitance on a pole.</p>

	<p id="fenderlight">The next project progressed to controlling a few led's using two buttons. It was a lot easier with the full-sized already-built arduino but things get trickier once you go custom from the ground up</p>

	</ul></div>

	<p>The last iteration to date gets rid of the buttons and opens up the leds to being controlled over a cable by another chip or another computer. This creates the groundwork for a bicycle taillight project I'm working on that also doubles as a turn signal.</p>

	<p>The video below shows the simplified communication level where I send a number over the usb connection that then prompts the device to cycle through "left turn", "right turn", and "braking". Future revisions will have more led's, better animations, and possibly wireless.</p>

	<p>Finally, I wrote a nicer more graphical interface for testing and playing with the board.</p>
