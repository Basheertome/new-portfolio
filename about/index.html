	<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Basheer. I'm a hybrid industrial &amp; interaction designer with a firm belief that products should feel beautifully designed even after the first button press.</p>
	<p>I use a unique blend of filmmaking tools, software prototyping, and electronics breadboarding in order to communicate and design new hardware interfaces.</p>
	<p>Through this parallel visualization and development, I'm able to shape a cohesive vision alongside business and engineering that more deeply embeds design throughout every stage of the product.</p>
	<p>After hours, you'll find me recklessly mashing buttons in <a href="http://aerostat.co/" target="_blank">Cinema 4D</a>, cooking <a href="http://thatwasdelicious.com/" target="_blank">food</a>, hoarding <a href="http://dragdrop.co/" target="_blank">imagery</a>, or rewatching the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhyScbAZrFs" target="_blank">Tron Legacy</a> fx reel.</p>
