	<p>I began learning how to work with custom circuit boards both on the programming and fabrication side. The first project itself focused on creating a programmer chip from a single-layer copper board, soldering some surface-mount components, and then finally programming it to run smoothly.</p>

	<p>From there I dove into learning how to use Eagle, one of the more widely used circuit board design tools and used it to create a "simple" board that measures capacitance on a pole.</p>

	<p>The next project progressed to controlling a few led's using two buttons. It was a lot easier with the full-sized already-built arduino but things get trickier once you go custom from the ground up</p>

	<p>The last iteration to date gets rid of the buttons and opens up the leds to being controlled over a cable by another chip or another computer. This creates the groundwork for my Instinct project's add-on where the taillight acts as a turn signal.</p>

	<p>The video below shows the simplified communication level by sending just a number and I cycle through "left turn", "right turn", and "braking". Future revisions will have more led's, better animations, and possibly wireless.</p>

	<p>Finally, I wrote a nicer more graphical interface for testing and playing with the board.</p>

	<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/81084879?api=1&color=3C92CF" width="900" height="506" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

	<p>Trying to design test patterns and interactions for the elastic shape display was tedious and difficult, so while my teammates were working on the lower-level hardware for the air pumps, I designed the Processing &amp; Arduino scripts above.</p>

	<div class="slideshow-container"><ul class="slideshow">

		<li><img src="optielastic2.jpg" alt="" /></li>
	</ul></div>

	<p>These scripts take a 5x10 pixel animated GIF as an input, using each frame as literal frames, the top half for color information, and the bottom half as a depth map. This is then both visualized on screen in 3d for debugging and sent to the hardware as an array. Take a look at the Processing script on <a href="https://github.com/Basheertome/processing-and-arduino/tree/master/OptielasticTable" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
